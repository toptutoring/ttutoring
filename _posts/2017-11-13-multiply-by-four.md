Today's math tip is how to quickly multiply by 4.

<!--more-->
How to do it? Simply double the number, and then double that number again.

**Example:**  
4 x 842 =
842 doubled is 1684, then that doubled again is 3368

**Another One:**  
4 x 1123 =
1123 doubled is 2246, then that doubled again is 4492

And that's all there is to it!
