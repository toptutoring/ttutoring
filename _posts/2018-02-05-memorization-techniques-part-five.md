Today we'll be exploring the last, and in my opinion, most powerful memory method in our series: the method of loci. This method is also commonly known as memory palace, journey method, or mind palace. The memory palace method was widely used in ancient Rome and Greece. As you can imagine, it was hard to come by paper and pen back then, and so if you wanted to learn something, you had to commit it to memory. Today, this popular method is used to achieve feats like memorizing the digits of pi or the order of shuffled cards in a deck. This method utilizes your spatial abilities, or visual memory.

To use this method, you start by visualizing a geographic location. It can be anything, from a city, street, park, to your house. If you are inclined, you can even create your own imaginary location. Once you have a location, you then map a journey through that place with various 'stops' along the way. For example, if you chose your house, you would imagine walking through the rooms in your house while marking certain locations or landmarks as 'loci'. You then associate each loci with what you are trying to commit to memory. Later, if you wish to memorize something else, you can replace the previous items at the loci along the route with your new items.

This all sounds rather abstract, so let's use a simple real life example to help you see how it works. Let's say you wanted to memorize this grocery list: bananas, apples, potatoes, onion, and carrot. Place each item along each consecutive loci in your memory palace. When it comes time to recall these items, you'll find it astoundingly easy to remember using your visual memory as you go along the journey in your mind.

This method can also be expanded by combining the other memory methods for each loci association. For example, using the chain method, you can place an object at a loci to represent an entire chain consisting of multiple objects. In this way, each loci is not limited to encoding just one piece of information and your possibilities become endless.

And this concludes our memory series. Do you have any other memory tips? Post in the comments section below!
