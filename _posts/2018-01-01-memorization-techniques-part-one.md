Are you tired of cramming only to forget the information right after (or even before) the test? Or have you been studying the same information over and over but somehow just can't get it to stick? Today we'll be starting a series on how to memorize information most effectively to help your studying efficiency (and for about just anything else you want to commit to memory). Once you learn how to implement these principles also used by the memory masters of the world, you'd be surprised why you didn't know about them sooner!

If these principles are so effective and great, why aren't they taught in school, you might ask? The reason for this is that many of these memorization techniques involve abstract thinking requiring unique imagery and creativity which varies from student to student. Since it is difficult to teach and standardize concepts across a large number of students, the current education system emphasizes methods such as rote repetition which are easy to adapt for all students.

Rote memory is based on repetition and involves repeating and reviewing information until it becomes 'solidified' in your memory. It's also useful for when a quick recall from memory is needed, such as for short lists, or dialing a phone number you just saw. Flashcards are also an example of this kind of learning. While memorizing information this way does indeed work with much effort, it is often time consuming and also easy forget facts learned by this method. This is why although cramming for tests might work, you'll find the information you remembered for the test is often fuzzy or nonexistent in your memory weeks later.

In the upcoming articles, we'll be exploring some well known (and not as well known) methods of memorization including techniques that professional memory masters use to accomplish amazing feats such as memorizing pi out hundreds of digits and the order of a deck of cards, so stay tuned!
