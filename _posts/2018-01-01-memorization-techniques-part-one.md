Are you tired of cramming only to forget the information right after (or even before) the test? Or have you been studying the same information over and over but somehow just can't get it to stick? Today, we'll be starting a series on how to memorize information most effectively to help your studying efficiency (and for just about anything). Once you learn how to implement these principles also used by the memory masters of the world, you'll be asking yourself why you didn't learn about them sooner!

If these principles are so effective and great, you might be wondering why they aren't taught in school. The reason for this is that many of these memorization techniques involves abstract thinking that requires unique imagery and creativity which varies from student to student. Since it is difficult to teach and standardize concepts across a large number of students, the current education system emphasizes methods that are easier to adapt for all students such as rote repetition.

Rote memory is based on repetition and involves repeating and reviewing information until it becomes 'solidified' in your memory. It's also useful for when quick recall is needed, such as for short lists, or dialing a phone number you just saw. Flashcards are also an example of this kind of learning. While memorizing information this way does indeed work with much effort, it is often time consuming and does not ensure long-term memory. This is why although cramming for tests might work, you'll find the information you remembered for the test is often fuzzy or nonexistent in your memory weeks later.

In the upcoming articles, we'll be exploring some well known (and not as well known) methods of memorization including techniques that professional memory masters use to accomplish amazing feats such as memorizing pi out hundreds of digits and the order of a deck of cards, so stay tuned!
