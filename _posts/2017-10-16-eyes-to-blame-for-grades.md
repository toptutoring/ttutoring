#### Real Life Story
When I first met my husband, one of the things I quickly learned was that reading almost any book could knock him out instantly. The Zzs came so quickly, it was like a spell had come over him! To this day, he still doesn't like reading (and it still lulls him to sleep), and over the years he's developed the uncanny ability to have a "photographic" hearing memory instead.

#### Why?
As it turns out, his eyes naturally rest pointing outwards more (like, a LOT more) than the normal person, and so to read he was expending copious amounts of energy to keep his eyes focused up close. Naturally, when you are straining your eyes for long periods of time, you get tired (not to mention getting double vision, headaches, and other annoying problems). Aha! Now he finally had an excuse for not studying back in college (or not).

#### What's This Got To Do With Me?
The experience of my husband is not unique. A surprisingly large amount of people with binocular vision problems (a fancy name for problems affecting how the two eyes work together) go undiagnosed, like my husband up until recently. Other symptoms people may experience related to binocular vision include seeing double, blurred vision, and headaches. All these problems make it difficult to study, and oftentimes people wrongly attribute this to things like laziness or low IQ. There are so many who go undiagnosed and never know why they can't focus or study. Don't be one of them!

#### What's The Cure?
In my husband's case, all he needed was a pair of glasses with prism, which would position his eyes resting out comfortably (where they like to be). For others, depending on the underlying eye problem and what their lifestyle needs are, they may need things like reading glasses, vision therapy (exercises for the eye), or contacts.

#### Conclusion
My husband so wishes he had known about this years before, as it would have saved him years of difficulty focusing and studying. If you find yourself consistently getting tired after reading for just short periods of time, seeing double, having difficulty focusing your eyes, or getting headaches, consider heading to your nearest optometrist (preferably one who specializes in binocular vision) to rule out or identify any underlying ocular problems. Look forward to effective studying!
