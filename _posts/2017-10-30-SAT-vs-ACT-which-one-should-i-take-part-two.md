In the [first post]({{ page.previous.url }}), I discussed some of the differences between the SAT and ACT, and suggested you take a practice test for each. In this post, I want to talk about the SAT vs. ACT from my experience tutoring both tests. The main thing I want to say is this:

<!--more-->

### **The new SAT has been changed to become very similar to the ACT** ###

#### Here's how:
 1. The **essay is now optional** (the SAT used to require it).  
 2. **No more rote vocabulary memorization** of obscure words; there are less vocabulary questions overall and the vocabulary questions are put into the context of a reading passage.  
 3. **No more single sentence grammar questions;** all grammar questions are put into the context of a reading passage.  
 4. **No more experimental questions** on the SAT (which shortens the exam time).  
 5. **Trigonometry** is now tested on the SAT Math section.  
 6. The **reading of charts/graphs** in now included in the the SAT; the Science section of the ACT has always tested the reading of charts/graphs.  
 7. The SAT now consists of **four sections;** it used to be ten sections long. This requires a longer attention-span than before.  

#### What does this practically mean?
 - **Preparing for one of the tests ultimately prepares you for the other.** Therefore, there is really no reason why you shouldn't take both tests.

 - What this also means is that **the best tutors for the new SAT are those who are experts in the ACT** -- and here at Top Tutoring, we have tutors who have worked with the ACT for years and they can help you prepare well for the new SAT.
