The short answer is YES!!!

Let me explain. The old versions of the SAT were notorious for the analogy and sentence completion questions, such as:

#### **Example 1**
Because rap and hip-hop offer such _______ commentary on contemporary issues, they are often said to be sharp-edged musical genres.

##### **Answer Choices**:
**a.** nebulous  **b.** trenchant  **c.** circumspect  **d.** prosaic  **e.** benign

#### **Example 2**
OBSEQUIOUS : SERVANT : :

##### **Answer Choices**:
**a.** cooperative : colleague  **b**. omnipotent : monarch  **c**. mordant : worker  **d.** valorous : dastard  **e.** servile : employee

Students and parents complained that it seemed worthless, impractical, and tedious to memorize obscure vocabulary words that people will rarely hear and/or read in their everyday lives. The College Board test makers removed the analogies in 2005 and removed the sentence completions in 2016.

HOWEVER -- **it is a mistake to think that learning advanced vocabulary is now unnecessary to do well on the SAT.** The new SAT still tests vocabulary in the following ways:

#### Vocabulary in context questions (like on the ACT), such as:
In line 42, "want" most nearly means...
In line 12, "dedicated" most nearly means...

#### Difficult vocabulary *within* the reading passages themselves.
If you can't understand the passage because you don't recognize certain words, you'll be handicapped when answering the questions. Many of my students do not understand the passages they are reading because they do not know the meaning of various words.

#### Difficult vocabulary *within* the test questions and/or answer choices.
You might understand the passage well, but if you don't recognize words in the questions and/or answer choices, you'll never be able to use your understanding of the passage.

So, even though there are no longer questions that focus exclusively on vocabulary (like the sentence completions and analogies), **you  still need to learn advanced vocabulary, especially if you want a high score.** In my experience, what often separates the good students from the best students is their knowledge of advanced vocabulary.

In another post, we will discuss **resources** that you can acquire (free and paid) and **strategies** you can use to build your vocabulary.
