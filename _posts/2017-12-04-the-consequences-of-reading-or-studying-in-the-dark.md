How often have you heard the old adage to not read in the dark because it's bad for your eyes?

Thankfully, I can assure you that reading in the dark does no harm to your eyes. Why the longstanding perception then? When we read in the dark, there is less contrast between the letters and the page, and our eyes get tired sooner because we have to strain more to make out the letters.

Additionally, when you read you tend to blink less frequently, which causes dry eyes and contributes to the feeling of tired eyes. In the dark, it is also takes more effort for your eyes to focus in on the reading material.

Still don't believe me? To date, no studies have proven that reading in the dark is bad for your eyes nor does it have any permanent effects.

So while you might get a headache next time you pull that all nighter, you can sleep well knowing it has no lasting effects on your vision!

How often do you study in the dark?
