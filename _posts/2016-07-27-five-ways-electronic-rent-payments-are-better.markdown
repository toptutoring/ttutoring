[This blog][blog] attempts to make managing properties easier.

> The more we automate, the more time we have to actually manage the property.

### No more lost checks

So many things we already lose, and sometimes checks get lost in the mail for
something that is not even in our control.

### Prompt payments

Electronic rent payments can be set to recur, so there is more reliability in
when they will arrive.

### No need to deposit

Who wants to visit the bank every time they receive a check?

### Saves time

Being able to accept payments electronically saves time to think about and do
things that are more valuable for the property.

### Tracks late payments

If someone receives payment for 100 units, it is extremely difficult to track
which checks are late and which ones are on time because each unit may have a
different start date. It is also difficult to keep a history of payments for
that unit.
