For those who know me, I'm someone who misplaces my keys (and other items) on a daily (yes, daily) basis. There was one time I was in the car with my husband, and we heard a strange clicking sound on the freeway. Lo and behold, my keys were left flailing in the wind clinging on for dear life! It's been such a huge time drainer and frustration in fact, that my husband has now bought me a [Tile][tile-app] to keep track of my keys. And while I am thrilled to say I can now find my keys quite easily, I still have the same penchant for losing almost everything else.

If you have even a modicum absent-mindedness as I do, you will LOVE electronic rent payments. And if you're like most landlords, you're probably still taking rent payments via paper checks. Let me explain why electronic payments are so much better:

### You don't lose it.

There's enough to keep track of in our lives as it is without adding one more thing to the mix. If you don't have checks, then you don't have anything to misplace or lose. It's not only embarrassing to re-ask a tenant to send a payment, but it's just a downright hassle. And if you live far away from your tenant, even more difficult.

But what if I am OCD and keep tabs on everything, and never lose my checks, you say? Well, the postman most definitely can (and does) still lose it! Save yourself the headache and use online payments.

### More time.

Unless you are one of those rare people who get a kick out of spending time visiting your bank to deposit checks on a regular basis, managing little slips of papers, and following up with tenants for lost payments (and nothing wrong with that, more power to you!), most people would rather do other things with their time. Imagine all the things you can do with more time. Not only can you focus on managing others aspects of the property, but you have more time for YOU and what's important to YOU. 

### $$$ Pronto.

No more waiting for the snail mail (it's called snail mail for a reason) to arrive in order to get your payday. With online payments, your payday is much faster. Not only that, with [Plexmate](http://www.plexmate.com) tenant payments can be set to recur automatically, so you can predict exactly when your next payment will arrive, and with recurring payments your tenant no longer has to worry or remember when to send the payment each month. An all around score!

### Easy Peasy Payment Tracking

Not only can you have the basic ability to track things like late payments, but crazy hair pulling calculus calculation-inducing situations are no longer required. For example, for tenants that consist of multiple roommates, the rent is often split multiple ways, and not equally at that. Electronic payments not only takes care of that but even allows you to even see the history of previous payments. 

### Your Tenants Will Love You

My most favorite reason of all. Be prepared for the thank you cards, flowers, gooey baked warm chocolate cookies to roll in! Ok, maybe your tenants won't love it THAT much, but still, we haven't met a tenant yet who doesn't like electronic payments! No more paper tongue cuts from licking the icky envelope and stamp. No more thinking about when to write another check. As another bonus, the trees will love you too!

Be nice to yourself and your tenants, and use electronic payments.
