If you're like most people who own both glasses and contacts, you don't give much thought to which you're wearing when studying or reading. However, you'll be surprised to learn that which one you wear indeed can affect how well you study. Today we'll be exploring the pros and cons of each and which one you should be using.

#### Are You Hyperopic or Myopic?
The first piece of information that determines whether contacts or glasses are more beneficial for you while studying is whether you fall into the category of hyperopic or myopic (and if you've been blessed with perfect vision, or plano, this article is probably not too relevant for you), aka farsighted or nearsighted. If you're unsure, to determine this take your regular glasses (the ones you use to drive or see far away), and look to see if the lens is thicker in the middle or on the edges. If its thicker in the middle, you are hyperopic, and if they are thinner in the middle -- you guessed it, you're myopic. For most people who wear glasses regularly, you'll most likely fall into the category of myopic.

#### If You're Myopic
If you are nearsighted, you should study with your glasses on. The reason lies behind the difference in distance between the lens and eye when you wear glasses vs. contacts. In general, your spectacle lens is positioned about 12mm away from your naked eye. When myopic prescription light rays pass through the spectacle lens, the power reaching the eye becomes weaker and weaker (or more positive) as the distance increases between the lens and your eyes. Thus the contact lens which sits directly on your eyes has a higher effective power compared to your spectacle lenses.
For reading, you want the lower power to be most comfortable which is obtained by wearing glasses. With a weaker power, your eyes have to do less work to focus in order to read. You may also have already known this subconsciously such as when you push your glasses down your nose while reading.
And depending on your base prescription (ideally low astigmatism and low power), you can take further advantage of this concept by taking off your glasses/contacts off completely to read for even more comfort, requiring your eyes to focus even less.

#### If You're Hyperopic
If you're hyperopic, the converse is true, and you should wear contacts while studying (assuming all you're concerned about is how hard you're working to focus). With hyperopic prescriptions, the power becomes more negative (or minus in prescription terms) the farther the distance the lens is from the eye. With more negative powers, the eye has to compensate more to focus up close and therefore you may find yourself more tired when you read with glasses and not contacts.

There are many other factors that affect your comfort while reading such as light level, dryness (especially with contact lens wear), natural eye resting position, and even age (those 40 and up usually need some form of added reading prescription), but this is a good starting point in helping you decide the best way to study for long periods of time. Lastly, don't forget the 20/20 rule: for every 20 minutes of up close work, look into the distance or across the room for 20 seconds to relax your eyes.
