Hi, I am a Sophomore at UC Berkeley with Regents scholarship, the most prestigious scholarship awarded to undergraduates at UC Berkeley. I am intended Statistics and Economics double major. I was the President of Math Club and Peer Tutoring Club, was the Academics Editor for yearbook, and participated in the Robotics team at my high school.

Currently I am involved in Financial Literacy and Economic Justice Conference at UC Berkeley, and am also involved in the Web Development team at Undergraduate Statistics Association. Besides my academics, I am involved in fencing and love hanging out with my friends. You should choose me as your tutor not only because I have many years of tutoring experience but also because I love teaching and sharing my love and excitement of mathematics and other subjects with you guys!! No matter what education background you are from or what grade level you are, I would love to be your tutor. I hope to get to know you more as a personal level and further boost your grades and academics to the top notch level! Hope to see you soon!
