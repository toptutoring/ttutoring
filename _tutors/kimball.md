I’m a Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholar entering my sophomore year at Berkeley. I’m majoring in Physics and minoring in Computer Science, and it’s been my dream for as long as I can remember to become a professor. I’ve been tutoring my classmates and local families in math since high school, and I’m always hoping to help the subject click for people.

If there’s one thing that I want to do, it’s to help other people see math the same way I see it—beautiful, elegant, and a little bit mysterious.
