Hi my name is Reilly Olson. I'm an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley, intended Economics and Linguistics double major. I participated on my high school's speech and debate team for all four years, ultimately serving as the Prepared Speech captain my senior year. I also have been a paid instructor for three years at a summer speech and debate camp where I taught middle and high schoolers how to write and deliver a speech. I was also Managing Editor of my high school's newspaper and ran cross country in the fall and pole vaulted in the spring.

Currently at Berkeley I'm involved with Cal Rotaract, a huge service organization that completes multiple large scale projects throughout the semester. I'm also a SAGE mentor at a local elementary school in Berkeley and a writing coach through WritingCoach Connection. In my free time I like to go on hikes and check out boba and coffee places with my friends. I'd love to be your tutor because I enjoy solving problems and helping people work through different challenges. I'm also great with kids of all ages and am extremely patient and friendly!
