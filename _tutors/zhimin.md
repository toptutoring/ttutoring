My name is Zhimin, and I am an incoming sophomore at UC Berkeley double majoring in Economics and Music. My economic courses give me a strong background in mathematics while my humanity courses in my music major help me become a great researcher and writer. During my time at Berkeley, I have been working on an ongoing research project that analyzes the decline of the classical music industry. By incorporating concepts from my two majors, I am determined to revive classical music.

In my free time, you can find me practicing viola or piano in a practice room or sitting at a caf√© having a heated debate about the labor market with a total stranger. Growing up having to balance my academics and music career has made me an expert at time management, so I am happy to discuss any academic questions or any little tips and tricks to help you succeed in school.
