Hi! My name is Richard Qi and I was born and raised in the suburbs of Los Angeles. I am an incoming second year student at UC Berkeley studying Business Administration and Statistics. To me, tutoring other students is not only a way of spreading my own knowledge, but also a means of discovering new things that I may not have known before.

In the past, I had the special privilege to work with students of all ages and backgrounds. Subjects that I believe that I can be help you with include SAT II Subject Tests (specifically Biology, Chemistry and Math II), AP Tests (specifically Calculus AB/BC and US History), and also the ACT exam. I was once in your shoes before and I understand the difficult process of scoring well on these exams. But with my prior experiences with taking these exams and dozens of practice exams beforehand, I believe I can help you get the scores you want!

Besides tutoring, I love being outdoors hanging out with my friends and playing sports such as basketball and football. You can also always catch me hiking new trails wherever I go and exploring the best places to eat in the city. Hopefully you see me as a potential fit as I would love to work with you to help you get the results you want.
