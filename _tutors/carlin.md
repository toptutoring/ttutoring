My name is Carlin, I’m an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. Ever since my first visit to Berkeley at age 12, moving away from home and attending a university has been my most eager goal. I focused my high school years on scoring highly on numerous AP tests and the ACT, and graduated as a valedictorian with a 4.3 GPA. Outside of academics, I spent 8 years studying at a Los Angeles Fine Arts Conservatory, choreographed and performed in my school’s theater and dance departments, and served as Vice President of my high school class.

At UC Berkeley College of Letters & Science, my academic focus is on the Social Sciences. I am studying History and Sociology and intend to minor in Education. Although maintaining my 3.8 GPA requires many agonizing hours at the library, I’ve made sure to enjoy my time at Berkeley by working for Cal’s fashion and arts magazine, mentoring Berkeley and Oakland elementary students, and reaching out to disadvantaged communities in the Bay Area through workshops in dance and creativity. I have gained work experience through companies such as Advancing Women Executives, which focuses on empowering women in the workforce, and Age of Learning, which develops online curriculum for children around the world. After I graduate, I intend to pursue a career in education reform.

When I’m not at school or work, I love to go on road trips with my best friends and family, check out concerts and art exhibits in LA and the Bay Area, and go on hikes with my dog, Libby! Above all, education is my passion. I'm really looking forward to working with you!
