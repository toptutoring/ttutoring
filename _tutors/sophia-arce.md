I am a sophomore at UC Berkeley, with a prospective Global Studies major and Spanish minor. I’ve always been fascinated by international affairs and culture, and aspire to one day have a career that enables me to make a difference in the world, like working at an NGO or organization like the UN. For now, I find the best way to make a difference on a smaller scale is through inspiring other students to learn and pursue their own academic interests.

In high school, I was a member of the National Honor Society and California Scholarship Federation, as well as being a National Hispanic Scholar. I have experience tutoring in basic levels of math and science, but am most adept at teaching the social sciences and language arts. Essay writing is my forte, and I would love to help high schoolers craft the writing portion of their applications for colleges and scholarships– or just essay assignments for school! It would be great to contribute to enriching a student’s academic experience, since my own has been such a positive aspect of my life.
