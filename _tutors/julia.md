I am an English and Psychology double major at UC Berkeley and I am passionate about teaching. I enjoy working with kids of all ages, and while I have a lot of experience tutoring in math and science, I love English literature and writing. I believe that working one-on-one is the best way to help students because it allows me to personalize and tailor my teaching to their individual learning styles.

In high school I was a National Merit Scholar Finalist and a member of the National Honors Society. I played water polo for my school, and I continue to play on the club team at Cal. When I was younger I did taekwondo as well and earned my black belt at the age of twelve. I also love cooking and baking, and I am currently working on making the perfect macarons.
